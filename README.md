# Laravel Blog App
This is a simple blog app built with Laravel, a popular PHP web framework. The app allows users to create blog posts, assign them to categories and tags, and add comments to existing posts.

## Getting Started
To get started with the app, you will need to have PHP, Composer, and a local development environment installed on your machine. You can download PHP and Composer from their respective websites, and install a local development environment such as XAMPP or WAMP.

Once you have these prerequisites installed, follow these steps to get the app up and running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the composer install command to install the required dependencies.
4. Create a new MySQL database for the app.
5. Rename the .env.example file to .env, and update the database connection details to match your local environment.
6. Run the php artisan migrate command to create the required database tables.
7. Run the php artisan serve command to start the app on a local web server.
8. You should now be able to access the app in your web browser at http://localhost:8000.

## Usage
